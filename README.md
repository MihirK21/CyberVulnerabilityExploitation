File: FileCryptography.psm1 is the PowerShell module file which needs to be imported to the target machine. This script module consists of code which is required to encrypt different types of files using AES encryption method.

File:EncryptFiles.ps1 is a PowerShell script used to encrypt all the files in a provided target path using AES encryption. The AES key which would be used to encrypt all the files is: "Q5KyUru6wn82hlY9k8xUjJOPIC9da41jgRkpt21jo2L="

File:DecryptFiles.ps1 is a PowerShell script used to decrypt all the files in a provided target path using AES. The AES key which would be used to decrypt all the files is: "Q5KyUru6wn82hlY9k8xUjJOPIC9da41jgRkpt21jo2L="

This project is a continous live code base where different functionalities would be added over time.

Prerequisites:
1. Administrator access required for a Windows machine.
2. PowerShell 5.1 must be installed.
3. Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser Bypass // This command should be fired before running the scripts.
4. Import-Module .\FileCryptography.psm1 // This module should be imported before running the encryption and decryption scripts.

Current Limitations:
1. Need to have administrator access on the target virtual machine.
2. Need to run the scripts manually on the target virtual machine.
3. The script is not hidden in any way.

Future Prospects:
I plan to modify the scripts in such a way that this script will hide itself in an image or a PDF format and when the user clicks the malicious file, all the files in certain folders would be encrypted and the encryption key would not be traceable.
